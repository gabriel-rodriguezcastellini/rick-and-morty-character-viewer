# Rick & Morty Character Viewer

This project is a simple web application that allows users to view and filter characters from the Rick and Morty TV show. The application uses the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to fetch character data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **View All Characters**: Fetch and display a list of all characters from the Rick and Morty API.
- **Filter Characters**: Filter characters by name, status, species, type, and gender using input fields.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through multiple pages of characters with pagination controls.
- **Toggle Extra Information**: View additional character details such as origin, location, and number of episodes by toggling a "Show More" button.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if API requests fail.
